## Description

This is a script which searches a JSON data file for information and displays the results on page. It uses a JSON file to featch information about Cities, States and Populations. By writing this script I practiced:

<li>Practice using fetch() and promises</li>
<li>Practice writing template literals</li>
<li>Practice writing event listeners, query selectors and functions.</li>
<li>Practice using .map and other array methods</li>
<li>Practice GitHub workflow. </li><br>

## Usage

You can test the app here: https://manonthemon.github.io/city-searcher

The JSON file could be replaced with an API call to a larger/different locations database.
